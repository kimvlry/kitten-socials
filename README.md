# üêæ KittenSocials: A Social Network for Cats

Welcome to **KittenSocials** ‚Äî the most adorable social network you'll ever find, built not for people, 
but for their murziks. 
Owners can register their kittens, set their breed and purring loudness, and ‚Äî most importantly ‚Äî help them 
make friends with other kittens. Because even introverted tabbies need some sort of social life. 
**No ugly brainrot there, just meow-meow.**

## Features
- **Create kitten friendships** across different owners.
- **Advanced kitten search** with **filtering** on:
    - name
    - breed
    - coat color
    - purr loudness!
    - birth date
- **Secure backend**:
    - passwords are stored encrypted.
    - stateless authentication via **JWT tokens**.
    - secured endpoints: your kitty‚Äôs personal page is protected ‚Äî only you (~~and admin~~) can access it, thanks to `Spring Security` and **role-based** access control.
